# git 

Sometime git bash is more convenient than git GUI or tortoise Git.
Especially it is in some situations of multiple opearations.It just need some codes to do a lot of opeartions.
Of course,it also can copy.So it is so convenient.But it is just in sometime.

Most situations GUI is more convenient.HBuilder intergrated tortoise Git and it can commit by clicking the mouse.
